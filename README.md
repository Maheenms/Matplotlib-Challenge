### Conclusion/Analysis:

After calculating and plotting all the required data and tables. I've come up with the following conclusions:

   * Observing the summary table above, we can see that the capomulin and ramicane regimen had the best results in reducing the tumor volume as compared to the other drug regimens. All, other statistical values (median, variance, std and sem) were also lower for the capomulin and ramicane regimen as compared to the others. The Ketapril regimen was observed to be the least effective on the tumor and the tumor volume was higher as compared to the volumes under capomulin and ramicane regimens.

   * When we look at the bar chart, we can see that Capomulin and ramicane have similar timepoints as compared to the rest of the drug regimen. Propriva has the least number of total timepoints and also number of mice tested on. Majority of the mice were treated with capomulin and ramicane drugs which showed better results in terms of reducing the tumor volume.

   * Looking at the line plot for Capomulin treatment of mouse id l509, we can see that the initial size of the tumor volume is 45 (mm3), after 20 days of treatment it increases to about 48(mm3). The size fluctuates over the course of the next 25 days but in a decreasing manner. After 45 days of treatment, the tumor volume decreases to about 41.5 (mm3).

   * Looking at the Correlation scatter plot, and after calculating the correlation coefficient using pearsonr formula, we can see that there's a strong positive correlation (0f 0.84) between the mouse weight and average tumor volume. A change in the value of mouse weight will predict a change in the same direction in the average tumor volume.

   * Looking at the pie plots, we can observe that more male mice were used for the study as compared to female mice.  Further analysis based on the sex, may lead to finding the different effects of potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)on male and female mice.
