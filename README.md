# Pymaceuticals-Matplotlib-Challenge

 Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens

### Conclusion/Analysis:

After calculating and plotting all the required data and tables. I've come up with the following conclusions:

   * Observing the summary table, we can see that the capomulin and ramicane regimen had the best results in reducing the tumor volume as compared to the other drug regimens. All, other statistical values (median, variance, std and sem) were also lower for the capomulin and ramicane regimen as compared to the others. The Ketapril regimen was observed to be the least effective on the tumor and the tumor volume was higher as compared to the volumes under capomulin and ramicane regimens.

   * Looking at the line plot for Capomulin treatment of mouse id l509, we can see that the initial size of the tumor volume is 45 (mm3), after 20 days of treatment it increases to about 48(mm3). The size fluctuates over the course of the next 25 days but in a decreasing manner. After 45 days of treatment, the tumor volume decreases to about 41.5 (mm3). 

   * Looking at the Correlation scatter plot, and after calculating the correlation coefficient using pearsonr formula, we can see that there's a strong positive correlation (0f 0.84) between the mouse weight and average tumor volume. 

   * Looking at the pie plots, we can observe that more male mice were used for the study as compared to female mice. But we do not have the data of the effect of all the regimens on the female mice as compared to male mice. If we do more analysis based on the sex, we may be able to find the effect of potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
